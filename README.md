# Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger program written in Python using the `pynput` library. It logs keystrokes and separates special keys from regular text in the output log file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
       https://github.com/Pythonist-ux/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
2. Install the required dependencies:

       pip install pynput

## Usage

1. Run the keylogger.py script:

       python keylogger.py
   
2. Press keys on your keyboard. The program will log the keystrokes to a file called keylog.txt in the same directory.

## Notes
Special keys (e.g., 'Shift', 'Ctrl') are logged as "[Special Key: {key}]".
Regular text keys are logged as-is.
